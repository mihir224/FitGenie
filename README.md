# FitGenie

My version of [GymGenie](https://gymgenie.vercel.app/)

I have implemented the home, sign-in/sign-up and the workout plan pages through React.

To run the project locally on your computer, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/mihir224/FitGenie` 

to clone the repo in your system and then in the project directory run

### `npm start`

to start the development server
